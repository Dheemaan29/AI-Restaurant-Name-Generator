# AI-Restaurant-Name-Generator

With the help of the gpt-35-turbo-instruct model, Azure OpenAI, and the Langchain framework, I have developed a Basic Restaurant Name Generator application. Streamlit Platform is the host for the application. The restaurant name is automatically generated, and the name of the dish for that restaurant is generated based on the restaurant name. Every time you select a different country, a different outcome is produced(Sometimes it can make mistakes)
